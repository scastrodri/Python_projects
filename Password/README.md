# Create and 'guess' passwords.

* Creates an 8-letter password by combining characters from three strings (letters, CAPS, numbers).
* Creates a four-word password by combining words from three lists (nouns, verbs, and adjectives).
* Have at least one capital letter and a number in your password.
* How many guesses would it take to guess a 4 letters password? - If you change this to a 5-letter password will increase the amount of time due to the calculations.

## Resources used:
**Python version:** 3.11
**Packages:** random

## Little disclaimer

* Don't use this to create your passwords, the random python package it's psuedo-random, and the script doesn't have any kind of cryptology or encoding, so please use
another tool for that purpuse.
