# Graphing data with the Turtle
* There are many tools to graph data, but let's 'code' our own graphs from scratch using the turtle module.
* The data used is part of [Kiva](http://kiva.org/) that is an international nonprofit, founded in 2005 and based in San Francisco, with a mission to connect people 
through lending to alleviate poverty.
* The first one will be a bar chart that shows the total amount of loans for country.
* The second one is a scatter plot that prints the loan amount vs the total number of lenders.
* The last one is a histogram (using the bar chart) that is used to display 10 differents 'buckets' that are 'categories' from the loan amount.
