#  Object Detection with Amazon Sagemaker

* Sagemaker provides a number of machine learning algorithms ready to be used for solving a number of tasks.
* Train and deploy an object detector using Amazon Sagemaker.
* Using the SSD Object Detection algorithm from Sagemaker to create, train and deploy a model that will be able to localize faces of dogs and cats from the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset.

## Resources used:
* **Python version:** 3.8
* **Packages:** os, tarfile, urllib, shutil, json, random, numpy, boto3, sagemaker, tqdm, matplotlib
* Based on the Coursera guided project [Object Detection with Amazon Sagemaker](https://www.coursera.org/projects/object-detection-sagemaker)
